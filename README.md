# MyBlog2

MyBlog2 is named as such because of a novice error while trying to
fix MyBlog.  (I deleted it from my pc - and without knowing - deleted it from Github)

This is the first project in [Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011).

Each html file is linked to its own CSS file. Making the CSS easier to read, @import is used.

Hope you enjoy and are encouraged by what you read.

# How it works

[index.html](index.html) is the best place to launch the website.  There are two other pages with links supplied to and from each other.

One of the pages [index_More.html}(index_More.html) has a couple of audio files attached.

The pages are responsive - utilizing @media in the CSS.
